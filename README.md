#First Project

Hey! This is my test project where i try different things while learning html, css and possibly js.  
So, basically the point oh this project is:  
1.Learning html
2.Learning css, styles, animations, etc
3.Learning how to make cool scripts with js
4.Making some cool features to show on page
  
Right now this is a page that describes some points about how to start learning something new and keep your motivation.  
That's all for now, bye!
